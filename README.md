# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Study Guide was created as part of my prework requirements for my Monash Bootcamp Coding course.  The guide is intended to provide a useful resource that I can refer to if I have any queries regarding what I learned as part of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and git modules forming part of my prework.

It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript.

A console panel should open either below or ot the side of the webpage in the browser (see image below).
